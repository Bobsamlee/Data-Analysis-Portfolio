# SQL Queries

## 📌 Overview
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and 
furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and 
large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria. 
I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of 
KMS. The Business Manager has shared an Excel file containing order data from 2009 to 
2012 and has requested that I analyze the data and present my key insights and findings.

11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer 


SELECT 
    "Order_Priority", 
    "Ship_Mode", 
    COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_Count, 
    SUM(Sales * Discount) AS Estimated_Shipping_Cost
FROM
    KMS_Case_Study
GROUP BY 
    "Order_Priority",
	"Ship_Mode"
ORDER BY 
    "Order_Priority", 
	"Ship_Mode"; 

---How to interpret:

---High-priority orders should ideally use Express Air more frequently.

---Low-priority orders should lean toward Delivery Truck (economical).

--If high-cost methods are used for low-priority orders, this suggests inefficient shipping spend.
