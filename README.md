## üìå Overview
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and 
furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and 
large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria. 
I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of

2012 and has requested that I analyze the data and present my key insights and findings.

11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method
and_Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on_the Order Priority? Explain your answer 


SELECT 
    "Order_Priority", 
    "Ship_Mode", 
    COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_Count, 
    SUM(Sales * Discount) AS Estimated_Shipping_Cost
FROM
    KMS_Case_Study
GROUP BY 
    "Order_Priority",
	"Ship_Mode"
ORDER BY 
    "Order_Priority", 
	"Ship_Mode"; 

How to interpret:

	- High-priority orders should ideally use Express Air more frequently.

	- Low-priority orders should lean toward Delivery Truck (economical).

	- If high-cost methods are used for low-priority orders, this suggests inefficient shipping spend.

# ‚úÖ Key Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Technology is the top-selling product category, with sales over $5.98 million ‚Äî 
it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs biggest revenue driver.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales are concentrated in a few strong regions (West, Ontario, Prairie) while regions like Nunavut, 
Northwest Territories, and Yukon generate very low sales.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Appliance sales in Ontario are relatively small ($202K) ‚Äî a targeted marketing push there could help.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The 10 lowest-spending customers are clear ‚Äî they could generate more revenue with personalized offers, 
loyalty programs, or better customer support.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Delivery Truck is the shipping mode with the highest total cost ($51,971.9) ‚Äî it‚Äôs economical but slow. 
Meanwhile, Express Air is faster but more expensive.
The data suggests that shipping spend may not always match order priority ‚Äî 
there‚Äôs room to align shipping mode with urgency to control costs better.

6Ô∏è‚É£ The top customers buy multiple product categories ‚Äî cross-selling works! 
Protect and nurture these valuable accounts.

7Ô∏è‚É£ The highest-value small business customer (Dennis Kane) and the most profitable consumer customer 
(Emily Phan) show it‚Äôs possible to grow specific segments.

8Ô∏è‚É£ A few corporate customers (Justin Knight, Laurel Elliston) place frequent orders ‚Äî 
they should be prioritized for account management and special deals.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Returns exist ‚Äî linking return behavior to customer segments will help improve quality and reduce unnecessary costs.

# ‚úÖ Actionable Recommendations
‚úîÔ∏è Focus on best-selling categories (Technology) ‚Äî expand the range, upsell accessories, or offer bundle deals.

‚úîÔ∏è Grow weaker regions ‚Äî run regional promotions, partner with local distributors, or tailor products to underserved markets.

‚úîÔ∏è Engage low-spending customers ‚Äî targeted emails, loyalty rewards, and personalized follow-ups.

‚úîÔ∏è Optimize shipping spend ‚Äî match shipping method to order priority more tightly.
Avoid using fast (expensive) shipping for low-priority orders.

‚úîÔ∏è Protect key accounts ‚Äî assign account managers to top corporate clients and high-value consumers.

‚úîÔ∏è Investigate returns ‚Äî find the root cause (product issues, delivery delays?) and fix it.

# üìà Bottom Line

KMS is strong in Technology and core regions. To grow, focus on expanding underperforming regions and customer segments, 
improving shipping efficiency, and deepening relationships with top customers while lifting bottom-tier buyers.
